# LLAMA-VISION-CHAT

## Overview

`llama-vision-chat.py` is a Python script leveraging the Llama 3.2-Vision model to analyze images and generate detailed descriptions. The script can output the analysis to a file or display it directly in the console.

## Features

- Utilizes the Llama 3.2-Vision model for image analysis.
- Utilizes Ollama to run the model locally.
- Outputs analysis to a specified file or prints it to the console.
- Provides comprehensive descriptions of image content, including any text detected.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Ollama 0.4.1

## Installation

1. Install the required Python package:
    ```sh
    pip install ollama
    ```

2. Pull the Llama 3.2-Vision model:
    ```sh
    ollama pull llama3.2-vision
    ```

## Usage

To execute the script, use the following command:

```sh
python llama-vision-chat.py <image_path> [output_file]
```

- `<image_path>`: The path to the image file to be analyzed.
- `[output_file]` (optional): The path to the output file where the response will be written. If not provided, the response will be printed to the console.

### Example

```sh
python llama-vision-chat.py food-plate.jpg food-plate-output.txt
```

This command analyzes the image `food-plate.jpg` and writes the response to `food-plate-output.txt`.

## Sample Outputs

Sample outputs from trial runs for two images are available in the `samples` folder.
